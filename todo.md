# TODOs / Nice to haves....


- Add a small 'X' in the top right corner that calls `Window.close()` to simulate closing the app without having to force quick or navigate away.
- add a splash screen?
- add feature so that when you press and hold the background "something" happens. Not sure what yet.
- fix bug that on iPhone with notch is showing a white background instead of fixing the body of the application correctly.
